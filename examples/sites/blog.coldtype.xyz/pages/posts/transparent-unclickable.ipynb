I probably should’ve done this in the video above, where I briefly made my own code invisible because of the blue text overlaying it. I could’ve avoided that by adding `-wo 0.5` to the command-line invocation, which would’ve cut the transparency of the whole window in half, meaning even a full-alpha color in the rendered viewer would've been transparent (and I could’ve seen all of the code)."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyO6/e2bZXquocbzYquVM3dn","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
